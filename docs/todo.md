Patches welcome!

* For REST requests, always set MIME type to application/json
* Make less boilerplate code for examples/phoenix.pl by adding more to Arizona::Engine::Handler
* CPAN packaging
* Generic file upload & download architecture?
* Templar should take pluggable template engines
* Pluggable Authn (do not do Authz, too domain specific)
* ErrorCatcher/Err classes should have the option of using log4perl?
